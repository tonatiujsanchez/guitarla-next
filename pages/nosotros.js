                        <p>Popular belief, <strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. <strong>Richard McClintock</strong>, a Latin professor at <strong>Hampden-Sydney</strong> College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.<strong>Written in 45 BC.</strong> This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, <strong>"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.."</strong>, comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
                        <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the <strong>industry's standard</strong> dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type <strong>specimen book.</strong> It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. </p>
